## Language requirements:
- [X] HTML.  Take advantage of semantic elements offered in HTML5 where applicable.

- [ ] Try to use BEM for naming classes (http://getbem.com/naming/).
- [X] Use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery.

## Functional requirements:
- [X] Must be responsive and function on desktop, mobile, and any resolution in-between.
- [X] The main page container must be centered and not exceed a max-width of 1240px.

    - [X] logo at the top (can be text styled with CSS)
    - [X] sidebar navigation
    - [X] a banner image
    - [X] social links
    - [X] main encyclopedia content (text with multiple heading and paragraph elements, and images)
- [X] Include images within the body text with appropriate, reusable classes to wrap text around them.
- [X] The sidebar navigation must feature expandable categories.  
    - [ ] The categories must also be able to be linked (note that you're only tasked with building a single page, but the functionality of a linked expander must be present).
