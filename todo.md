## Language requirements:
- [X] HTML.  Take advantage of semantic elements offered in HTML5 where applicable.
- [X] CSS or SCSS.  Styling must be done from scratch.  No external CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. are allowed, with the exception of normalize.css or a comparable CSS reset.  Font Awesome or similar is also allowed for icons.
- [ ] Try to use BEM for naming classes (http://getbem.com/naming/).
- [ ] Use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery.

## Functional requirements:
- [X] Must be responsive and function on desktop, mobile, and any resolution in-between.
- [ ] The main page container must be centered and not exceed a max-width of 1240px.
- [ ] The page must prominently feature a 
    - [X] logo at the top (can be text styled with CSS)
    - [X] sidebar navigation
    - [X] a banner image
    - [X] social links
    - [ ] main encyclopedia content (text with multiple heading and paragraph elements, and images)
- [ ] The sidebar navigation must feature expandable categories.  The categories must also be able to be linked (note that you're only tasked with building a single page, but the functionality of a linked expander must be present).
- [ ] On mobile, the sidebar turns into an expandable menu accessed via a header, with its expandable categories remaining intact within.  This may be done as a separate element that is only visible on mobile, but is also possible to have the sidebar change to the header.  How to do it is up to you.
- [ ] Interactive elements must include hover states and CSS transitions.
- [ ] Sidebar items must feature an active class to indicate the current page.
- [ ] Include images within the body text with appropriate, reusable classes to wrap text around them.
